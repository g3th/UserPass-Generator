# Username and Secure Password Generator

This script will generate a username with three random number suffix based on "Word of the Day", and a secure password which contains symbols, numbers and letters.

A password is considered 'strong' should it meet the following rules:

- It has at least 6 characters and at most 20 characters
- It contains at least one lowercase letter, at least one uppercase letter and at least one digit
- It does not contain three repeating characters in a row.

This script adheres to all the previous rules and, moreover, eliminates all repeating characters. It also allows the possibility of choosing how many letters your password should be, with a minimum of 8 letters required.
